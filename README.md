# Mapping-Earthquakes-Challenge

## Summary

The purpose of this repository is to create visual representations of earthquakes using the US Geological Service's data for earthquakes in the last seven days. In addition to active earthquake events, we utilized tectonic plate data to designate where fault lines are relative to earthquakes. We created three distinct maps using mapbox's Light, Satellite and Dark versions. In addition to the diffeent map styles, we created three tile layers to map earthquakes, tectonic plates and major earthquake events (magnitude > 5).
